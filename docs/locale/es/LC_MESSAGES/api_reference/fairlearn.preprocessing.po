"This method will change the original dataset by removing all correlation "
"with sensitive values. To describe that mathematically, let's assume in "
"the original dataset :math:`X` we've got a set of sensitive attributes "
":math:`S` and a set of non-sensitive attributes :math:`Z`. Mathematically"
" this method will be solving the following problem."
