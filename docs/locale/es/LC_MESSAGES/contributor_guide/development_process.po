"Development happens against the :code:`main` branch following the `GitHub"

"Contributors should use their own forks of the repository. In their fork,"
" they create feature branches off of :code:`main`, and their pull "
"requests should target the :code:`main` branch. Maintainers are "
"responsible for prompt review of pull requests."

"features, change APIs, etc., i.e., for changes that are relevant to "
"developers and/or users please also add an entry in CHANGES.md in the "
"section corresponding to the *next* release, since that's where your "
"change will be included. If you're a new contributor please also add "
