"Unfairness mitigation algorithms take form of scikit-learn-style "
"estimators. Any algorithm-specific parameters are passed to the "
"constructor. The resulting instance of the algorithm should support "
"methods :code:`fit` and :code:`predict` with APIs resembling those of "
"scikit-learn as much as possible. Any deviations are noted below."

"Reduction constructors require a parameter corresponding to an estimator "
"that implements the :code:`fit` method with the :code:`sample_weight` "
"argument. Parity constraints for reductions are expressed via instances "
"of various subclasses of the class :class:`fairlearn.reductions.Moment`. "
"Formally, instances of the class :class:`.Moment` implement vector-valued"
" random variables whose sample averages over the data are required to be "
"bounded (above and/or below)."

"All of the currently supported parity constraints (subclasses of "
":class:`.Moment`) are based on sensitive features that need to be "

"Post-processing algorithms (such as the ones under "
":py:mod:`fairlearn.postprocessing`) provide the same functions as the "
"reductions above albeit with :code:`sensitive_features` as a required "
"argument for :code:`predict`. In the future, we will make "
":code:`sensitive_features` optional if the sensitive features are already"
" provided through :code:`X`."
